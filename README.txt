This is a repository to store my master thesis in evolutionary computation for neuroscience.

Proyect description: The main goal of this project is to develop an algorithm capable of assisting in a neuro-stimulation treatment. To this end the algorithm try to optmimize brain-graphs by changing the wieghts of the wieght matrix through evolutionary strategies.

1) Analysis of healthy graphs.
2) Optimization of pathological graphs using the refrence from healthy graphs.
3) Map the changes on to the patient's head to apply neuro-stimulation.

Evolutionary algorithm programed in DEAP python library using custom functions.
